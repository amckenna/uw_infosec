## Intended For UW Guest Lecturers and iSchool Instructors

* The purpose of these courses are to serve as a guide and baseline for incoming iSchool guest lecturers who do not have time nor resources to construct materials of their own. If you find any of this information to be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated, please contact the owners of the repository so we can continue to improve the curriculum!

## A Note to Instructors

* It is always best to teach topics that you are excited and knowledgeable about. We encourage you to check the extra labs section to see if there are any lessons you wish to substitute out. 

### These courses have been vetted by industry professionals and the IAC Track Advisory Board as of May 2018.
