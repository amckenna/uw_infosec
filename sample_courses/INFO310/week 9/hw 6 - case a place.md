## Case a Place (30 points)

Note: This is not a collaborative homework assignment. You should complete this on your own. Do not do anything illegal and do not get yourself in trouble!

### Choose a Place
To do this assignment properly you must find a store, resturant, coffee shop, or some place that sells things and is not part of a larger facility. A Starbucks, Wendy's, QFC, or standalone store such as that would work fine, but the cafe in Suzzalo library, for instance, would not.

### Case the Place
Your goal is to threat model the place and perform a preliminary physical pentest. You'll want to be able to gather information that enables you to write the report detailed below. It is important that you do not trespass, loiter, or do anything that is illegal while performing this assessment. You are simply scouting the place as if you were a customer and I would recommend buying something like a coffee, sandwich, or cookie for information gathering purposes, yum.

Observe the following and keep them in mind when answering the questions in the next section. This is just a subset of the things you should look out for. Think like a secret agent, burglar, police, and accountant:
- Video cameras
- What brand of point of sale terminal they use
- If they have a back office
- The entrances and exits from the building
- Their hours
- The number of employees
- The roles of the employees
- Where is the place located in relation to other nearby stores, general foot traffic, police stations, etc.

### Threat Model
In a few sentences each, please answer the following questions about the place you chose.

1. What place did you choose?
2. Describe the physical layout of the place.
3. What are the assets that at attacker would want get ahold of?
4. What are the components, technological, physical, and human that an attacker would manipulate, hack, or encounter?
5. What are current protections in place to protect the assets?
6. How could you exploit the human components to gain access to the assets?
7. How could you exploit the physical components to gain access to the assets?
8. How could you exploit the technological components to gain access to the assets?
9. Combine the exploits described above into what you think would be the most effective way to gain access to the assets.
10. How could the place protect itself from the exploit just described?
