## Breach Report Report (28 points)

Note: This is not a collaborative homework assignment. You should complete this on your own.

### Choose a Breach Report
In the resources folder on Github there is a breach-reports folder. Choose a breach report from that folder to use for this assignment. Do not choose simply on the length of the report, choose based on whether the content can help you answer the following questions. I suggest reading this whole assignment before choosing a report.

### Deliverables
Read over the breach report you chose and use it to answer the following questions. Your responses should be roughly 2-5 sentences in length and geared towards a semi-technical audience, such as a fellow Informatics student. The responses should go into enough detail that someone who hasn't taken this class can understand it.

1. What is the breach you choose?
2. What is the asset that the hackers stole, or were attempting to steal?
3. What is the component that the hackers exploited in the process of stealing or attempting to steal the aforementioned  asset?
4. What is the vulnerability that the hackers exploited?
5. What would have been a technical mitigation that would have prevented the hackers from exploiting that vulnerability?
6. What is a possible problem or consideration that should be taken into account if the mitigation were to be implemented?
7. What is a high-level or broad enterprise policy that, that if put in place or followed, would have helped prevent this breach?
8. What is a possible problem or consideration that should be taken into account if the enterprise policy were to be implemented?
9. What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
