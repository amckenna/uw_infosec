Group Homework Assignment

~3-5 people per group, individual submission

Pick a malware sample (not CryptoWall and not something we have gone over in class) & write it on the board (no duplicates)

Write a formal report (will probably be >3 pages and look sort of like this (Links to an external site.).) containing:

1. An executive-level overview of the malware, what threat does it present for a company?
2. The threat actor’s motivation for making or deploying the malware, is is targeted or commodity?
3. Common infection, exploitation, and persistence vectors (doesn't have to be super technical, but you're welcome to make it as in-depth as you'd like).
4. How a company might detect the malware - note if it employs any anti-detection mechanisms.
5. Suggestions for mitigating an infection and preventing further infections - are there any issues that could be created by your suggestions?
6. Include references, resources, or further readings as an appendix - don’t copy / paste from existing reports - that’s plagiarism.
7. Relevant screenshots are welcome / encouraged.
