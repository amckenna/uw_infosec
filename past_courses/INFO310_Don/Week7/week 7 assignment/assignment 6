Come up with a hack that exploits something in your everyday life. 

Your paper should be roughly a page -- clarity and brevity are valued here. Make sure you clearly describe the situation or system you're exploiting, how it's intended to work, and how it can be exploited. At this point, don't choose a tech target; keep it "IRL."

For this paper, include how the hack could have been prevented.
