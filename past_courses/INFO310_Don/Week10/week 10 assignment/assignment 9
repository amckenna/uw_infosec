This paper will be significantly different. You may find yourself writing up to two pages.

At this point, you should be well versed in how to subvert systems and technologies as well as have an idea about how to prevent that subversion, so for the last weekly paper, we're going to do something a little more involved -- we're going to plan a crime.

You assignment is to plan the perfect crime -- one that you realistically would not be caught executing. Identify a target of monetary value and identify how the systems are intended to work. Identify how to exploit those systems successfully to extract something of monetary value.

Finally, identify a way that the crime you've planned could be prevented.

Note that this one is worth double points.
