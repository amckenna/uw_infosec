This lab is to create a threat model for a basic Content Management Server (CMS). The CMS must have three user roles -- the Administrator that manages the CMS, the Editor who provides content, and the Reader who consumes content. It must use a database to store content and configuration. 

The Level 0 diagram that was presented in Monday's lecture is a good starting point:

It is a Microsoft Threat Model Tool file. You can get the Threat Model Tool here:

Or, if you prefer, I've created a more concise version of the lab as a Word Document.

You don't have to use the diagram or the threat model tool. You can sketch your diagram on the back of a napkin -- that's fine. Just make sure it passes the validation criteria and that you've identified all the relevant threats via the STRIDE per element technique.

As usual, accepted file formats are Word or PDF.
