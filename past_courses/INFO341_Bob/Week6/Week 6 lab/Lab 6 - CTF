Lab 6 - CTF

I've set up a virtual network environment in cloud.

I will give you credentials to ssh / rdp into a kali linux machine
Username: student
Password: info341

Imagine you've hacked someone's computer, and now you are in victim's network.
From what you learned last week about Nmap, try to find some clues to jump to other machines.
This lab is only available during lab time today. If you want to play with it let me know. I can spin it up for you.
This is a CTF (Capture The Flag) style lab where you will hack into machines finding clues to find a flag. 
There are total of two flags. 
Hint!

If you decide to use SSH instead of RDP, you will need to be able to browse through command-line. In other words, send HTTP request through command-line
One way of doing this is using Netcat tool.  
nc [IP address or FQDN] [port number]
GET [Resource Path] HTTP/1.1 
Host: [IP or FQDN]
[enter again to send request]
example
nc 192.168.1.17 1234
GET /v1/admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.17:1234
I am intentionally giving out minimal information as possible to allow yall to explore
