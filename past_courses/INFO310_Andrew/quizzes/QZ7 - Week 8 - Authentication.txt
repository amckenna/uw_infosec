Question 2 - 3pts
Why is authentication important?

Question 3 - 4pts
What are the three factors of authentication? What distinguishes each factor from the others?

Question 4 - 4pts
From a high level - why does 2 factor authentication provide greater protection? Why is it used for high-security applications?

Question 5 - 4pts
When building a web-based authentication system (i.e. login form) what are at least 4 important requirements to verify and why? Include the thing that should be verified and the reason why. An example (and you can't use this one): Verify the login form uses paramertized SQL queries to perform user credential lookups. Using paramertized SQL queries prevents SQL injection.
